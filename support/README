Map support code, v1.0
Written by John Oberbeck
=============================

This is the first iteration of our support code for the creation and use of maps
in GLIDE.  Currently, it includes a TileMap class which is made of an array of
Tiles.  Each tile represents a type of terrain, at this point consisting of AIR
(empty space to move around in), CLOUD (border, impassible space), and GATE
(Goal space for completion of level).
Currently implemented in TileMap is the functionality to print out a textual
representation of maps, and also to create a level from a text document.  This
is accomplished using the following system:
    0 = Air
    1 = Cloud
    X = Gate
The code is easily extensible to include further types of terrain as we expand
the set of potential Tile types.  It will also be easy to completely subclass
each Tile type, if we find we need that much specialization.
