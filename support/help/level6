So Aaron is sitting in class, bored. Completely oblivious to the dull mumblings of his teacher, he gazes wistfully out the window. Warm spring air wafts in lazily from the open window, bringing with it the soft drone of the lawnmower outside.

Looking across the room, Aaron sees his best friend, Sally, has fallen asleep. Knowing that Sally is already in trouble for forgetting her homework, Aaron realizes he needs to wake her up without letting his teacher find out. Aaron quickly rips a sheet out of his notebook and fashions the most versatile and awesome paper airplane known to man, YOU.

"Go, GLIDE" he whispers, "go find the student named Sally and wake her from her slumber!"
*****
Unfortunately Aaron's teacher, Jack Janooti, is super evil and hates when his students have fun. 

He has assigned the students to sit in alphabetical order so that Aaron and Sally are not near each other. 

You, GLIDE, need to find which seat is Sally's without causing too much of a commotion.

You may ask less than half the students for their names, depending on how awake JJ is feeling.

Let's begin!!!

Whenever you're faced with a problem you don't know how to solve, the first thing to do is to try and turn the problem into smaller and smaller problems until you know how to solve them. 

What if you were looking for a student C in a class of size 1? That's obvious, it would just be that student.

Now the question is: how do we get our problem, of size n, into what we know how to solve, which is size 1?

*****
What if we had a class of size 2? That would be simple: ask one student, and if it's not that one, then its the other one.
What about size 3? This is where it gets tricky. You can't just ask each one of them, and if you pick and random, you're not guarenteed to pick the right ones.
	     _______        _______        _______
            |       |      |       |      |       |
	    |   ?   |      |   ?   |      |   ?   |
            |_______|      |_______|      |_______|
	        1              2              3
The next step is to list the things you know to be true. 
    (1) Sally is in the class
    (2) The students are arranged alphabetically
    (3) There are n students, and no 2 students have the same name.
*****
Let's use what we know. If we pick a random student, then all the students that come before that student in line will have names that go before that student's name. All the students after that student will have names that come after that name.

Think about how you would look through a phonebook. Pick a page and see if the page you picked comes before or after the name you're looking for. If it comes before, then you can safety ignore all the names that come after. And vice versa.

Since we know that the name we want comes before the name we picked, BAM! We can throw away half the phonebook. So we now have a problem that's half as big as the one before!
*****
Let's say we're looking for a student named Eve.
So let's pick the middle.
	     _______        _______        _______
            |       |      |       |      |       |
	    |   ?   |      |  Bob  |      |   ?   |
            |_______|      |_______|      |_______|
	        1              2              3
OK, now we know Eve is not sitting in seat 2. But we also know she can't be sitting in seat 1, since alphabetically E comes after B.
What do we have left?

One student! Which is a problem we know how to solve.
*****
OK, so let's go back to a list of size n.
 ___   ___   ___       ___   ___   ___ 
|   | |   | |   |     |   | |   | |   |
| ? | | ? | | ? | ... | ? | | ? | | ? |
|___| |___| |___|     |___| |___| |___| 
  1     2     3        n-2   n-1    n
    
Where do we pick for our first student? We know the total size of the class, so we know where the middle is! 

Once we know what the name of the student sitting in the middle is, we can throw away the half of the seats which we know the student isn't sitting.

What are left with? A problem of size n/2. Keep halving the size of the problem, and eventually you will get down to 1!
