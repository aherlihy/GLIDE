ABOUT

What are we trying to teach you? To program.
But wait, hold up. What's a program?

A program is essentially a list of instructions
that your computer is going to execute.

Why is that cool?
Well, it's different for everyone.
Hopefully you will find your own answer.

Why do we think programming is cool?
Because it's imagining designing building and more.

As a programmer you can construct your own
universe where the laws are entirely up to you.
You can build complex systems from the most basic of concepts.
You are the artist, the architect, the designer.

You are problem solving
constantly discovering better and faster ways to get what you want.

Computers are extremely powerful tools - but that's just it - they're tools.
Computers are only as powerful as the programmers that tell them what to do.

Let's get started!
