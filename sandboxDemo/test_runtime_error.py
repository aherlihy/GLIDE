# This program is a template for a program run through the sandbox.
# For convenience, use this class to try various runtime exceptions.

# For each type of exception, uncomment the line and pass this path into sBox.py

# Simple examples:

#zero = 0
#num = 100
#kaboom = num/zero

#list = [10,20,30]
#kaboom = list[3]

# To test more unpredictable exceptions, throw by hand using raise <exception>
# Simple examples: 

#raise BufferError
#raise EnvironmentError
#raise OSError
