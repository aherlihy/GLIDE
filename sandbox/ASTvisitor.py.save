# This class represents the visitor that will go through and parse the AST generated from the user's code. 
# There are two ways to limit functionality: I could specify the visitors' behavior for certain nodes that the user shouldn't invoke
# Or, I could specify the visitors' behavior for nodes that are allowed (since this is smaller)
    # I would also override generic visitor so that everything else would flag the code as dangerous
# Concievably, if there's time, I could modify the user's code so that anything dangerous was just removed as opposed to just throwing an error.
# But that's totally it's own nest of worms.

# NOTE: The python library pages don't have a lot of information when it comes to implementing this stuff, so I found a tutorial on the AST module at http://codemonkeytips.blogspot.com/2010/08/simple-python-nodevisitor-example.html

    # The AST module handles visitors by providing a generic_visit method that does nothing to a node and recurses on it's children.
    # Type-specific visitors can be defined by writing a function 'visit_<classname>'
    # When generic_visit is called on a node and a type-specific visitor is defined for that node, the type-specific visitor will be called instead.
    # However every visitor recurses on it's children using generic_visit, since the child's type is necessarily known by the parent.
    # Here I've override generic_visit to print out the name of the node (for debugging). Note that my generic_visit then calls the super's generic_visit to continue the recursive tree traversal
